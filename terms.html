    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:29 October 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This document is provided in multiple languages. In case of any inconsistency, the English version shall prevail.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and JOM TRIP TECHNOLOGIES RESOURCES that governs the right to use the websites and applications offerings (collectively, the “Jomtrip Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Jomtrip,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to Jom Trip Technologies Resources whom you are contracting.<p>

<p>By creating an account, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms, Policies, and Standards. If you do not agree, do not use the Jomtrip Platform.<p>

<p>The Jomtrip Platform enables users (“Users”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Users who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and Users who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations (“Homestay”, “Property” or “Accommodations”) which are designated as experiences on the Jomtrip Platform (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). As the provider of the Jomtrip Platform, Jomtrip does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. Jomtrip is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Jomtrip a real estate broker, travel agency, or insurer. Jomtrip is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any User, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about Jomtrip’s role see Section 15.<p>

<p>Guest Terms<p>

<p>1. Searching and Booking on Jomtrip.<p>
<p>1.1 Searching.<p>
<p>You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of listing, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, popularity, and more.<p>

<p>1.2 Booking.<p>
<p>When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”).You are also agreeing that Jomtrip may charge the payment method used to book the Listing in order to collect Damage Report (as defined in Section 14) amounts.<p> 

<p>When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host. By making a Reservation you are agreeing to the terms of the contract. The terms of the contract include these Terms, all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these terms of the contract including these Terms and all terms of the Reservation including all rules, standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing.<p>

<p>An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) permitted by applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner permitted with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.<p>

<p>2. Cancellations, Reservation Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.<p>
<p>2.1 Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Refunds.<p>
<p>In general, if you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the host's cancellation policy (as defined in our REFUND POLICY) that applies to that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control forces you to cancel a Reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Major Disruptive Events Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Reservation Issue (as defined in our REFUND POLICY), you may be eligible for a full refund under the REFUND POLICY. You may appeal a decision by Jomtrip by contacting our customer service.<p>

<p>2.2 Booking Modifications.
<p>Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Jomtrip Platform or direct Jomtrip customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.<p>

<p>3. Reviews<p>
<p>After Host Services, you may leave Reviews. Reviews can be based on six aspects, namely Hygiene, Comfort, Convenience, Communication, Value for money and Description consistency, and can be accompanied by text, photos and videos. Reviews must be accurate and must not contain discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or illegal content. Your Reviews may be check and reply by the Hosts of the Host Services. If the Hosts dispute your reviews, They have right to appeal through Jomtrip platform. The Reviews will be deleted if it violate the rules.<p>

<p>4. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.<p>
<p>4.1 Your Responsibilities.<p>
<p>You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, all areas and facilities where the Accommodation is located that the Host and Guest are legally entitled to use in connection with the Accommodation (“Common Areas”), or any Service, Experience, or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) or Common Areas in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Report amounts, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you book a Host Service on behalf of additional guests, you are required to ensure that every additional guest meets any requirements set by the Host, and is made aware of and agrees to these Terms and any terms and conditions, rules and restrictions set by the Host.If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor. <p>

<p>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk.<p>
You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Jomtrip Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 9), including your stay at any Accommodation, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Users whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.<p>

<p>Host Terms<p>

<p>5. Hosting on Jomtrip.<p>
<p>5.1 Host.<p>
<p>As a Host, Jomtrip offers you the right to use the Jomtrip Platform in accordance with these Terms to share your Accommodation, Service, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.<p>

<p>5.2 Contracting with Guests. <p>
<p>When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Jomtrip Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering the Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. Jomtrip Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.<p>

<p>5.3 Independence of Hosts. <p>
<p>Your relationship with Jomtrip is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Jomtrip, except that Jomtrip Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Jomtrip does not direct or control your Host Service, and you understand that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.<p>

<p>6. Managing Your Listing.<p>
<p>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing<p>
<p>The Jomtrip Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price (including any additional charges), and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for your acts or omissions as well as keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.<p>

<p>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations.<p> 
<p>You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle).In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.<p>

<p>6.3 Search Results.<p> 
<p>The ranking of Listings in search results on the Jomtrip Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:<p>
<p>(a) Guest search parameters (e.g. number of Guests, destination, time and duration of the trip, price range),<p>
<p>(b) Listing characteristics (e.g. price, calendar availability, Reviews, length of time the Listing has been live on the Jomtrip Platform), and<p>
<p>(c) Host and Listing requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time)<p>
<p>Jomtrip may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Jomtrip Platform by paying an additional fee. For more information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content please contact our email.<p> 

<p>6.4 Your Responsibilities.<p>
<p>You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You are responsible for ensuring that all mandatory fees and charges applicable to your Listing are included in your price breakdown. You may not collect any fees or charges outside the Jomtrip Platform. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Jomtrip Platform.<p>

<p>6.5 Your Assumption of Risk. <p>
<p>You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Jomtrip Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Users whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Jomtrip Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Jomtrip.<p>

<p>7.Cancellations, Reservation Issues, and Booking Modifications.<p>
<p>7.1 Cancellations and Reservation Issues.<p> 
<p>In general, if a Guest cancels a Reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest. If you cancel on a Guest, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: (i) a Guest experiences a Reservation Issue (as defined by the REFUND POLICY), (ii) a Major Disruptive Event arises, or (iii) a Reservation is canceled under Section 12 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Jomtrip exceeds your payout, Jomtrip (via Jomtrip Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by deducting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that Jomtrip’s REFUND POLICY, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a Reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that Reservation until a refund decision is made.<p>

<p>7.2 Booking Modifications. <p>
<p>Hosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Jomtrip Platform or direct Jomtrip customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.<p>

<h3>REFUND POLICY</h3>
<p>If a Host cancels a reservation prior to check-in, their guest is entitled to a full refund.<p>

<p>If a Guest cancels a reservation prior to check-in, refund are determined by the host's cancellation policy:<br>
(a) Free cancellation available: A Guest can cancel anytime and get full refund,<br>
(b) Free cancellation up to 3 days in advances: A Guest can cancel 3 days in advances and get full refund, 50% refund if less, and not refundable within 24 hours,<br>
(c) Free cancellation up to 7 days in advances A Guest can cancel 7 days in advances and get full refund, 50% refund if less, and not refundable within 24 hours,<br>
(d) Cancellations are not available: A Guest is not allowed to cancel after booking.<p>

<p>If another Reservation Issue disrupts a stay, Guests must report Reservation Issues within 72 hours after discovery. If we determine that a Reservation Issue has disrupted a guest’s stay we’ll give the guest a full or partial refund. The amount refunded depends on several factors including the severity of the Reservation Issue, the impact on the guest, the portion of the stay affected, whether the guest vacates the accommodations, other mitigating factors, and the strength of evidence provided of the Reservation Issue.

<p>The term "Reservation Issue" refers to these situations:<br>
(a) Host cancels the reservation prior to check-in.<br>
(b) Host fails to provide their guest access to the accommodations.<br>
(c) Accommodations are not habitable at check-in, including but not limited to any of the following reasons: Not reasonably clean and sanitary, or Contain safety or health hazards.<br>
(d) Accommodations are significantly different than advertised, including but not limited to any of the following reasons:<br>
(e) Inaccurate space type (e.g. entire place, private room, or shared room).<br>
(f) Inaccurate type or number of rooms (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens).<br>
(g) Inaccurate location of the accommodations.<br>
(h) The Listing fails to disclose that the host, another person, or a pet will be present during the stay.<br>
(i) Special amenity or feature advertised in the Listing is not present or does not function (e.g. pool, hot tub, major appliance, heating, and air conditioning systems).<p>

<p>How to request a refund<p>
<p>To request a refund, the guest who made the reservation must contact us or their host within 72 hours after discovery of the Reservation Issue. Requests should be supported by relevant evidence such as photographs, videos, or confirmation of the conditions by the host, which we will use to help determine whether a Reservation Issue has occurred.<p>

<p>This Policy is applicable to the maximum extent permitted by law, which may imply guarantees that cannot be excluded. When this Policy applies, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s cancellation policy. Before submitting a request to us, whenever feasible, the guest must notify the host and try to resolve the Reservation Issue directly with their host. In connection with resolving the issue, guests can request refunds directly from hosts. We may reduce the amount of any refund under this Policy to reflect any refund or other relief provided directly by a host. We may also provide guests with the option of applying the value of a canceled reservation to travel credit, in lieu of a cash refund, provided that the guest expressly agrees to this option.<p>
